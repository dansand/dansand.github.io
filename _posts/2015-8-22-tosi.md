title: Thermal convection benchmark - Tosi et al.

In order to attain, plate-like behavior of the upper thermal boundary, numerical models often use a pseudoplastic rheology. Nicola Tosi and co-authers recently published results of a comparison of 11 codes running a series of 2-D visco-plastic models:  "_A community benchmark for viscoplastic thermal convection in a 2-D square box_". I've been working on an Underworld2 implementation of the models, which can be found here

And here is a rendering of the FeVariables during the solve...
