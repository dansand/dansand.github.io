Along with Masters student Phuntsho Pelgay, I developed some models to look at the temperature field under high relief mountains, with the assumption of a constant exhumation rate. Numerical models were run with Underworld. 
This ipython notebook contains the guts of the the process. Admittedly it's in a pretty rough stage, but please contact me if you're interested in using Underworld for this kind of work.
