title: Underworld2
---

Underworld2 is a Python package which is fully integrated with the parallel finite element code Underworld  (Moresi, L. _et al._ 2002).
Underworld2 will be officially launched very soon, but is available now through bitbucket. To get a working version of Underworld2 you will need to clone the newInterface branch (this will change after the launch).

The Underworld developers having building up examples showcasing tricks and features, check them out here: <https://bitbucket.org/underworldproject/underworld2>. A number of other examples can be found in my repository: <https://github.com/dansand/uw-bits>


```
import underworld as uw
import math
from underworld import function as fn
import glucifer.pylab as plt
import matplotlib.pyplot as pyplot
```
