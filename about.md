Inward Looking: A PhD home companion...

Earth is both self-gravitating and convecting - imagine a pot of soup extruded in a sphere around the burner, gravity always pointing inwards. And the soup is radioactive; and...and the analogy is stretching.

Over millions of years material moves vertically across the three-thousand-kilometer-thick mantle, as well as horizontally in vast sheets across the surface. These flows are convection cells. What we call the Plate Tectonics is a kind of surface-biased impression of the dynamics, for which scientists, being vastly superficial, must be forgiven.

It seems, however, there really is something unique about the plate-like surface (lithospere) of the earth. In simplest terms, this is because of faults and shear-zones, the very thin, weak boundaries that separate the plates on the surface, yet move, evolve and communicate with each other. Faults are an example of positive feedback (in physical parlance, non-linearity), whereby weaknesses promote motion which in turn decrease the strength allowing more motion. We know that without these feedback processes Plate Tectonics can't exist. Yet by watching other planets, and running simulations, we also discover that even with multiple feedback processes available, stable, long-lived Plate Tectonics is somewhat of a enigmatic state to find a planet (and perhaps, therefore, ourselves).

As we can neither explore the inner earth physically, or observe (directly) the millions of years of earth evolution we are interested in, Earth Science relies on indirect observation in time (geology), space (imaging and inversion) as well as analogue and numerical simulations a tool to facilitate experimentation, hypothesis testing as well as demonstrating concepts. I attempt to do the latter, with the enormous support of a community of scientists who willingly share their tools, ideas and enthusiasm.
